# Smart-Hostel
SmartHostel – Resident/Warden management (Flask + SQLite) A lightweight hostel management system with two roles. Residents book rooms (101–110, 4 beds), then—after warden approval—can submit service and outing requests. Wardens approve/reject, view live occupancy, and see color‑coded heatmaps for service density and bookings
